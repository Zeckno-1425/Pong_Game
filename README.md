# Pong_Game
This project is a simple game I created with the main goal of improving my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills. While developing it, I focused on practicing class inheritance, experimenting with GUI implementation, and getting more comfortable with list slicing in Python.

The project is not only about building a playable game, but also about strengthening my coding foundations by applying these concepts in a practical way.
